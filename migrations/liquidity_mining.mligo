    // full reward (`seconds_inside = total_seconds_unclaimed = total_seconds_for_reward`).
    //
    // If I trigger reward computation multiple times during the incentive's lifetime,
    // I will get the same full reward in the respective portions.
    // E.g. if my position is active 50% of the time during the first half of the
    // incentive lifetime, I will get
    // `reward
    //    = total_reward_unclaimed * (0.5 * 0.5 * incentive_lifetime / incentive_lifetime)
    //    = initial_reward * 0.25`.
    // If then I immediately stake the token again and keep the position active
    // 50% of the time, I will get
    // `reward
    //    = total_reward_unclaimed * (0.5 * 0.5 * incentive_lifetime / (0.75 * incentive_lifetime))
    //    = (initial_reward * 0.75) * 1/3
    //    = initial_reward * 0.25`

    //
    // If I'm not the only participant (stake) in this incentive, overall

    // were active, in such case the reward may get exhausted in the middle
